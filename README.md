# SleepingTime
iOS test app to record sleeping time

### In Development

The idea of this app will be to simply record your sleeping time automatically without having to click buttons or be forced to start a timer to record it such as many apps in the App Store (because Apple limits the background jobs). As this app doesn't have the intentions to go live, this will be a Dev App.

### Motivation

Since I migrated from Android I miss the functionality of my smartphone recording automatically my sleep (S Health), without the need of an elaborated app that I need to put charging near my head during the night or a smartwatch in your wrist or whatever. I just wanted a smart simple app that gets the job done. A simple sleeping stopwatch.


### Idea

(In Development)

The app will start recording your sleep within 30 minutes of inactivity (between 19:00 and 10:00).

If you wake up during the night to use your phone, the app won't count this time if you only used your phone for up to five minutes and got back to sleep.

Once you do wake up, the app will register your wake time and stop the timer.
